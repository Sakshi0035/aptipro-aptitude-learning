You are Gemini CLI. I have a React app from Google AI Studio (Apti-Pro app) with app.tsx and package.json.

Your Job:
1. Inside my current folder, set it up as an Expo React Native project called "Apti-Pro-app". Do not create a new folder outside this one.
2. Replace the starter app.tsx with my AI Studio app.tsx.
3. Merge dependencies from package.json and install them.
4. Run "expo prebuild" so I get android/ and ios/ folders.
5. Use package name: com.nana.Apti-Pro
6. Do not generate app icons. I will provide my own 1024x1024 icon.
7. Verify gradle and androidmanifest are correct and error-free.
8. Stop after confirming the android/ folder is fully ready for Android Studio.
